=head1 NAME

Singleton - ensures one and only one instance with global access.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Singleton is a design pattern that is useful when there must be exactly one
instance of a class and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known
point of access. Additionally, clients can use an extended instance (subclass)
without modifying their code.
