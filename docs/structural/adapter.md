Adapter
=======
The Adapter pattern converts the interface of a class into another
interface clients expect. Overcomes incompatible interfaces to allow
classes to work together that otherwise could not. This is useful
when you want to use an existing class but its interface does not
match the one you need or you want to create a class that will
cooperate with unrelated or unforeseen classes.
