Facade
======
The Facade pattern provides a high-level, unified interface to a set
of interfaces in a subsystem that makes the subsystem easier to use.
This is useful for providing a single simple interface to a complex
subsystem. Also useful for decoupling subsystems from clients and
other subsystems, thereby promoting independence and portability.
